I just came with the idea: what if I made a caesar cipher encrypter and decrypter? Can I do it in C? That's why I made this. I'm still a beginner in programming, so I'll listen to any suggestions to help make my code better. If you want to try it out just download the source code, run "make" on the terminal and execute the file that corresponds to what you want to do (encrypt or decrypt) located in the "bin" folder. There's also "make clean" and "make install-home", but that's more for me, although you can use them too.
